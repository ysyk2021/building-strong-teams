Teams are a critical component of organizational success. They enable individuals with diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives to work collaboratively towards achieving common goals. There are various types of teams that organizations may use to achieve specific objectives. In this chapter, we will discuss the different types of teams and their characteristics.

Functional Teams
----------------

Functional teams are organized around specific functions or departments within an organization, such as marketing, finance, or human resources. These teams typically consist of individuals with similar skills and expertise who collaborate to achieve departmental objectives. Functional teams can be permanent or temporary, depending on the organization's needs.

Cross-Functional Teams
----------------------

Cross-functional teams bring together individuals from different departments or functions within an organization to work on a specific project or objective. These teams promote collaboration and communication across different areas of the organization, allowing for a more holistic approach to problem-solving and decision-making.

Self-Directed Teams
-------------------

Self-directed teams are autonomous groups of individuals who work together to achieve a common goal. These teams have the freedom to make decisions and manage their work processes independently. Self-directed teams require strong leadership and communication skills, as team members must work collaboratively to achieve their objectives.

Virtual Teams
-------------

Virtual teams are geographically dispersed groups of individuals who work together using technology and communication tools. These teams can be permanent or temporary and are becoming increasingly prevalent in today's globalized world. Virtual teams require strong communication skills, as team members must communicate effectively despite not being in the same physical location.

Project Teams
-------------

Project teams are formed to complete a specific project or task within a set timeframe. These teams may include individuals from different departments or functions within an organization and may be temporary or permanent, depending on the project's duration.

## Consider the Team's History and Accomplishments

When choosing a team legend, it is important to consider the team's history and accomplishments. A story or myth that reflects the team's past successes and challenges can help team members feel connected to each other and motivated to continue building on their achievements.

## Involve Team Members in the Process to Ensure Buy-In and Engagement

To ensure buy-in and engagement, team members should be involved in the process of choosing a team legend. This can include brainstorming sessions or surveys to gather input from all team members. By involving team members in the process, managers can ensure the legend is meaningful and relevant to everyone on the team.

## Choose a Story or Myth that Aligns with the Team's Values and Purpose

The team legend should align with the team's values and purpose. It should reflect what the team stands for and what they are working towards. By choosing a legend that resonates with team members' values and purpose, managers can inspire a sense of shared vision and direction.

## Ensure the Legend is Compelling and Easy to Remember

The team legend should be compelling and easy to remember. It should be a story or myth that team members can retell and share with others. A compelling legend can help build team spirit and increase morale, while an easy-to-remember legend can help ensure it is passed down through the generations of team members.

## Conclusion

A team is a group of individuals who work together to achieve a common goal or objective. Unlike traditional work groups where members work independently on separate tasks, teams collaborate and coordinate their efforts to accomplish shared goals. Teams are often cross-functional and composed of members with diverse skills and experiences, which allows them to leverage the strengths of each member to achieve better outcomes.

Here are some additional details that you could include when defining a team:

- A team may be comprised of people with different backgrounds, skills, and areas of expertise.
- Teams may be formed for a specific project or task, or they may be ongoing and have a more permanent structure.
- A team may have a designated leader or manager to provide guidance and direction, though in some cases, teams may be self-managed.
- Effective communication and collaboration are key components of successful teams. Team members must be able to work together, share their ideas and opinions, and solve problems collectively.
- Strong teams are characterized by trust, respect, and mutual support among team members. Conflict may arise from time to time, but it is handled constructively and does not undermine the team's overall goals.
- Teams are often evaluated on the basis of their performance, which may be measured using specific metrics or indicators.

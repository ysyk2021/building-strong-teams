Defining Teams
=============================================

A team is a group of individuals who work together to achieve a common goal or objective. Unlike traditional work groups where members work independently on separate tasks, teams collaborate and coordinate their efforts to accomplish shared goals. Teams are often cross-functional and composed of members with diverse skills and experiences, which allows them to leverage the strengths of each member to achieve better outcomes.

Core values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that guide the behavior and actions of a team. Defining core values is an essential step in building a strong team culture. In this chapter, we'll explore the importance of defining core values and how to do so effectively.

## Why Defining Core Values is Important

Defining core values is important for several reasons, including:

### Guiding Behavior

Core values serve as a compass that guides the behavior and actions of team members. When team members share common values, they are more likely to work together effectively towards common goals.

### Supporting Decision-Making

Core values can help simplify decision-making by providing a clear framework for evaluating options and making choices that align with the team's values.

### Communicating the Team's Identity

Core values communicate the identity of the team, both internally and externally. By defining its core values, the team can communicate its identity and mission to stakeholders and potential team members.

## How to Define Core Values

Defining core values involves several steps, including:

### Brainstorming

The team should start by brainstorming a list of potential core values. This can be done through group discussion, surveys, or other collaborative methods.

### Narrowing Down the List

Once the team has generated a list of potential core values, they should narrow it down to a manageable number, typically three to five. This can be done through a voting process or by discussing and eliminating values that may not be essential.

### Defining Each Core Value

For each selected core value, the team should define what it means and how it will guide the team's behavior and actions. This definition should be clear and concise.

### Communicating Core Values

The team should communicate its core values clearly and consistently, both internally and externally. This can be achieved through the team's mission statement, website, and other communication channels.

### Reinforcing Core Values

The team should reinforce its core values regularly to ensure that they remain an integral part of the team culture. This can be achieved through recognition and rewards for team members who embody the core values.

## Conclusion

Defining core values is an essential step in building a strong team culture. By guiding behavior, supporting decision-making, and communicating the team's identity, core values can help a team work together effectively towards common goals. It is important for teams to involve all members in the process of defining core values and to communicate them clearly and consistently to ensure their effectiveness.
